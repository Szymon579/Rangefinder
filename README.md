# Rangefinder
## Distance measuring device project

The project involves designing, programming and construction of a distance measuring tool. 
Base of the project is the Arduino Uno R3 with the Atmega 328 microcontroller. 
The distance is calculated based on the data returned from the HC-SR04 sensor and displayed on a 2x16 LCD display. 
The system is powered through the USB-B interface built into the Arduino board.
